DQL - Data Query Language

1.Select(fetch the all data):-
->SELECT * FROM `table_name`;

2.Fetch selected column data:-
->SELECT `column_name1`, `column_namen` FROM `table_name`; 

3.Fetch unique data:-
->SELECT DISTINCT * FROM `table_name`;

4.Specific Data:-
->SELECT `column_name` FROM `table_name` where id = 101;

5.Aggregate Function:-
->SELECT SUM(`id`) as sum_of_id FROM `table_name` ;

->SELECT COUNT(`id`) as count_of_id FROM `table_name`; 

->SELECT avg(`id`) as avg_of_id FROM `table_name`;

->SELECT min(`id`) as min_of_id FROM `table_name`; 
->SELECT max(`id`) as max_of_id FROM `table_name`;

6.Arrange the column in descending or ascending:-
->SELECT * FROM `table_name` ORDER BY `id` ASC|DESC;

7.Join:-
->SELECT table1_name.column_name, table2_name.column_name...FROM table1_name LEFT JOIN table2 ON 
table1_name.column_name = table2.column_name;

->SELECT table1_name.column_name, table2_name.column_name...FROM table1_name Right JOIN table2 ON 
table1_name.column_name = table2.column_name;

->SELECT table1_name.column_name, table2_name.column_name...FROM table1_name Inner JOIN table2 ON 
table1_name.column_name = table2.column_name;

8. Like clause:-
->SELECT * FROM `table_name` WHERE `column_name` LIKE 'value%';
