Defination:-
1.Class is collection of data member and member function
2.Class is blue-print of the object
---------------------------------------
As per structure define as it is

how to define :
class//keyword class_name
{
    //statments
};//class body must be over|terminate
-----------------------------------
Rules:-
Only Define data member(variable define inside the class) in class
Not inisialize data member out of the function
inisialize value only inside the function
->inisialize min assign value to variable as shown below 
int no=100;
------------------------------------------
class any time not occupie the memory
Class get memory when object define of that class but that memory only of the object not class
